# xFilters
**Convolution** is a popular array operation used in signal processing, digital recording, image/video processing, and computer vision. This repository provides **convolution algorithm** written from scratch in **C++ (for CPU)** and **CUDA C++ (for GPU)**, which can be used to apply **filters** to **high resolution** images. 

## Supported Filters
### Sharpen

### High-pass (edge detection)

### Low-pass 

### Gaussian (image blurring)

### Derivative of Gaussian (edge detection)
